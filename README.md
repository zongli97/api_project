MIS2402 Semester-Long Project

Create a simple application that uses Web APIs

As you will discover in this course, there are web APIs available to programmers that allow them to create applications that can perform a variety of tasks. There are APIs designed to look up data (e.g. USA state codes, zip codes, etc.), and there are APIs that perform actions. Actions include tasks such as creating new data records, sending text messages, generating QR codes, and many other things.

Your semester-long project is to discover and research two APIs and develop a simple web application that uses those APIs.
This semester-long effort will be broken down into phases.

Phase 1 - Research (Due 9/14) Visit this resource: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis

Search through the categories of free APIs there and find two APIs that are interesting to you. One API should support the HTTP GET method (these are the most common) and the second API should support the HTTP POST method.
You will be expected to write a proposal that summarizes how you plan to use the APIs you chose.
You will submit your proposal to canvas for your instructor to review.

These are the API URLS I used for the project:

Phase 2 - Initial Prototype (Due 9/21)

You will create a static HTML prototype of your solution. Create at least two static HTML page(s) that suggest how your solution will work when it is done. In this phase, your code does not interact with the APIs. HTML tables, text, messages, etc. can be filled with mock data. You will have buttons and links in this phase that don’t work. They are just there for the sake of appearance.

Phase 3 - Improved Prototype (Due 10/5)

Improve the prototype you created initially. At this phase, you do still do not interact with the APIs. Tables, text, messages, etc. can still be filled with mock data. However, you should implement JavaScript code to perform simple error trapping and/or navigation. By the end of this phase, every button and link in your prototype solution should (at least) give the illusion of functionality.

Phase 4 – Construction (Due 11/18)

Refine your prototype solution further so that it interacts with both APIs. This is your attempt at presenting a whole solution. It should make use of an API that uses the HTTP GET method and an API that uses the HTTP POST method. It should contain error trapping, to prevent the user from sending bad data to the API. It should report back to the user the results of the API call. It’s use and utility should be obvious to the average user.

Phase 5 – Peer Review (Due 11/30)

You must review the work of three of your peers in the class. Your instructor will assign students to be reviewed by each other. Provide your peers with constructive criticism, and your assessment of their work. Your instructor will review all correspondence between peers. You will only receive credit for this stage if you provide statements that are both critical and constructive.

Phase 6 – Final Version (Due 12/5)

You must adapt your working prototype to use a Single Page Architecture. Correct any bugs identified by yourself and/or your peers.
